Project Title
AI Health Bot + Medical NFTs on Aptos

Selected Domain
Healthcare + Blockchain Technology

Problem Statement / Use Case
In traditional healthcare systems, patients have limited control over their medical data, and health records are fragmented across various hospitals and systems. Data sharing between providers is often inefficient, error-prone, and insecure. Additionally, in emergency scenarios or across borders, quick and trusted access to medical history is critical but often unavailable.

This project addresses these challenges by building a real-time AI-driven health assistant that generates instant medical assessments and stores them as encrypted Medical NFTs on the Aptos blockchain. These NFTs are owned by the patient and serve as portable, tamper-proof, and shareable health summaries.

The use case combines:

An AI Health Bot that offers instant diagnosis and recommendations based on symptoms.

A secure NFT system where each medical summary is minted as a Medical NFT.

A Medical NFT viewer (Medical NFTvis) that allows the user or authorized healthcare providers to securely view the data.

This approach ensures:

Patient ownership of medical data

Privacy-preserving access using encryption

Global portability of health records

Transparency and auditability using blockchain

The system features an AI Health Bot that interacts with users in real time, asking about their symptoms and medical history. Using natural language processing (NLP) and a trained medical model, it analyzes the input and provides a preliminary diagnosis or health advice. Once the consultation ends, the bot generates a medical summary that includes symptoms, possible conditions, recommendations, and a timestamp.

This summary is then encrypted for privacy and minted as a Medical NFT on Aptos. The NFT contains metadata such as patient ID (wallet address), date, and a hash of the encrypted medical content. This Medical NFT is sent to the patient’s crypto wallet, making them the sole owner of their medical data.

The Medical NFTvis (Medical NFT Viewer) module allows users or authorized doctors to view the content of NFTs by decrypting it with a secure key. The viewer presents data in a clean, user-friendly interface, enabling easy access and sharing with healthcare providers.

Technologies used include:

AI/ML for health prediction

Aptos Blockchain for NFT minting

Move language for smart contracts

Gradio/React for frontend visualization

IPFS or encrypted cloud for off-chain data storage

This real-time project addresses critical issues like data ownership, portability, and security in healthcare. It empowers users to carry their health records globally in a verifiable format while ensuring privacy and authenticity — a perfect example of blockchain’s impact on real-world healthcare.
